# Capstone-Project-1-Level-2-

This capstone project is a project management system for a small structural
engineering firm called “Poised”. Poised does the engineering needed to ensure
the structural integrity of various buildings. They want me to create a Java
program that they can use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.
Poised stores the following information for each project that they work on:

-Project number.
-Project name.
-What type of building is being designed? E.g. House, apartment block or
store, etc.
-The physical address for the project.
-ERF number.
-The total fee being charged for the project.
-The total amount paid to date.
-Deadline for the project.
-The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the
architect for the project.
-The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the
contractor for the project.
-The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the
customer for the project.

The user is able to either enter a new project or a new person(Architect, Contractor or Customer).
